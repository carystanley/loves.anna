          <div class="image"><img src="prov_31.jpg"></div>
          <p class="lead">
              10 A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than billions of dollars.
              11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.
              12 She brings him healthy food, not harmful gluten, all the days of her life.
              13 She selects kale and napa cabbage and works with eager hands.
              14 She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from Grocery Outlet.
              15 She gets up pretty early for work (compared to her husband)
              16 She picks a spot in the front yard and plants tulips.
              17 She brushes her teeth vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks (not as much for push ups).
              20 She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy with cupcakes.
              21 When it snows, she is feels really cold.
              22 She makes coverings for her table.
              23 Her husband is respected at Yahoo, where he takes his seat among the nerds.
              26 She speaks with wisdom, and gospel truth is on her tongue.
              27 She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the gluten of idleness.
              28 Her children arise and call her "Speech" (if they can, and appreciate her); her husband also, and he praises her:
              29 “Many women do noble things, but you are my Anna who surpasses them all.”
              30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
              31 Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise in Santa Clara.
